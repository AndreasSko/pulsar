Configuring the LWR Server:

Rename the server.ini.sample file to server.ini, and edit the values
therein to configure the server. Defaults as specified for all values
that will likely work for testing.

Running the LWR Server:

Install python setuptools for your platform:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

The easy_install command line application will be installed as part of
setuptools. Use easy_install to install the following libraries:

easy_install paste wsgiutils PasteScript PasteDeploy simplejson webob

The paster command line application will be installed as part of the
previous easy_install command. This application can be used to startup
an LWR server. Start this up by executing the following command:

paster serve server.ini 

Testing:

A simple sanity test can be run against a running LWR server by
executing the following command (replace the URL command with the URL
of your running LWR application):

python run_client_tests.py --url=http://localhost:8913

This project is distributed with unit tests, the following command
will install the needed python components to run these tests.

easy_install nose coverage webtest

The following command will then run these tests:

nosetests

The following command will then produce a coverage report
corresponding to this test and place it in the coverage_html_report
directory.
